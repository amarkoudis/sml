This is a placeholder for favicon.ico.

To create a custom favicon:
1. Use an online favicon generator (e.g., favicon.io)
2. Create a calendar-themed icon
3. Download the .ico file
4. Replace this file with your custom favicon
5. Keep the filename as 'favicon.ico'

Alternatively, you can use a pre-made favicon from a CDN by adding this line to your layout.html head section:

<link rel="icon" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.7.2/favicon.ico">
